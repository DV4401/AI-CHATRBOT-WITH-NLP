This Python script creates a simple AI chatbot using NLTK for natural language processing. The chatbot processes user input by tokenizing and lemmatizing text, then matches it against predefined intents (e.g., greetings, time, weather) using rule-based keyword recognition. It responds with randomized answers from a set of predefined responses, covering basic queries like "Hello," "What time is it?" or "Who are you?" The chatbot runs in a terminal loop until the user types "exit."
